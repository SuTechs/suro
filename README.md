# Suro - Flutter Showcase Platform

Suro is a platform for Flutter developers to showcase, share, and explore UI designs, animations, and components. Think of it as Dribbble for Flutter—a vibrant community where developers can inspire and learn from each other's work.

## 🚀 Why Suro?

While designers have platforms like Dribbble to showcase their work, developers often rely on GitHub for sharing code. Suro bridges this gap for Flutter developers, providing a visual platform to share not just code but the end result—beautiful, functional UI components and animations.
